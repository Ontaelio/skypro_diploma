### Python 3.10, Django 4.1.5, Postgres

* Project start, first commit.
* Docker and deployment stuff added.
* Authorization added.
* VK authorization is present, but doesn't work, as I don't have an account there.
Github authorization is working, but not present on the front. Check /api/oauth/login/github manually.
